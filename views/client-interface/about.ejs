              <br />
              <h6>
                It all began in a cozy corner of Beirut over a cup of coffee,
                with two passionate book lovers, Maya and Lina. Their dream? To
                bring reading to every Lebanese home-anytime, anywhere.
                Together, they created BookVerse, a modern online bookstore
                offering English, Arabic, and French titles at your fingertips.

                BookVerse is built on a shared love for literature. From
                Lebanese classics to global bestsellers, from book clubs to
                curated recommendations - it’s a community space for readers.
                Maya crafts her weekly literary picks while Lina elevates the
                reading experience with clean UI, accessibility, and thoughtful
                features.
